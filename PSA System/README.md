# PSA System
<sub> Copyright &copy; 2024 red-ornob. Licensed under LGPL-3.0-or-later. </sub>


Here are a few YAGPDB scripts I wrote to implement a PSA system on Study Sage. 


This code sends a PSA message 3 hours after the most recently sent message, and if there has been at least 6 messages since the last PSA; on each of the selected channels individually.


These conditions may be easily changed and there may be different conditions for different channels.


Make sure to read the comments and configure the script before usage. Feel free to reach out for help.
